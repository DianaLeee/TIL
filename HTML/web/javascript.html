      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed,
        prototype-based,
        multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three
        core
        technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online
        programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it
        without
        the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a
        different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not
        supporting
        the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
